# Dynamic Weighted Ensemble Approach

The proposed dynamic ensemble approach updates the combining weights after obtaining each new forecast. Unlike the static ensemble methods, a combining weight 
in the present formulation depends on both the particular model as well as the time index. Each time, the weight is updated on the basis of the past and most recent 
forecasting performances of the respective component model. Empirical results with four real time series datasets and nine component models demonstrate that the 
proposed dynamic ensemble approach has substantially improved the forecasting precision for each time series. Also, the proposed approach has achieved reasonably 
better forecasting results than each component model as well as various other well recognized static time-invariant combination schemes. Thus, from the present study 
it can be concluded that using time-dependent combining weights can be a fruitful approach for improving time series forecasting accuracy.
